# 🇧🇷 Contextual Analysis of Cyber Threats (2015–2024): Focus on Brazil

## 📑 Introduction and Project Contextualization

This **Security Data Analysis** project aims to explore and contextualize the landscape of cyberattacks observed globally between 2015 and 2024. I used a simulated attack *dataset* to apply data analysis techniques within the fields of *Security Operations* (SecOps) and *Threat Intelligence*.

### 🎯 Main Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to isolate and interpret general attack data that impacted **Brazil**. Although cyber threats are intrinsically global, **vulnerability, legislation (such as LGPD), and attack vectors** often manifest in unique ways within the Brazilian digital environment.

The focus is on identifying information that can lead to the improvement of the national cyber defense environment. Understanding the main targets, major attacks, financial losses, mitigation time, and other relevant data.

### 🧪 Analytical Methodology

The analysis is conducted using the **Pandas** library for data manipulation and transformation. The methodology involves:

1.  **Cleaning and Normalization:** Preparation of raw data.
2.  **Trend Identification:** Analysis of the evolution of attack types (*Ransomware*, *Phishing*, DDoS) and their frequency over the ten-year period.
3.  **Threat Mapping:** Visualization of the temporal distribution of attacks in the country.

### ✨ Relevance

This study seeks to go beyond raw statistics, providing *actionable intelligence* that can inform defense strategies. The focus on Brazil is essential to understand which **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**, are preferred by adversaries targeting Brazilian organizations and users.
